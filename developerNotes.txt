#This account is used for testing purposes, mainly to see how raids work.
#In order to check what happens when the user wins a raid, simply click until the raid boss's lp has been lowered to 0. 
#An animation should occur of the boss dying to then showing a 'raid successful' screen.
#To check the boss's attack, the game should wait 30 seconds or so until the animation happens, and the lp of the pet should decrease.
#To test if the raid was unsuccessful, change pet to either 'Nibble' or 'Doge', by instantly killing the current 
 pet through the button hidden in the tree when the pet heads outside.
#Feel free to use as many totems as needed to revive any pets since there is a large amount of them.
#After the 30 seconds are up, the pet's lp should drop to 0 and the screen should show 'raid unsuccessful'.

#Pet automatically loses 1 energy, 1 happiness and gains 1 hunger every 3 seconds.
#Totem - revives dead pet.
